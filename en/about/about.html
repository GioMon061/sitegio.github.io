            <p>FROM A CAREER CHANGE TO SUCCESS IN DESIGN: THIS IS HOW I TURNED MY PASSION INTO A SERVICE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.</p></div>
			<div><p class="about-paragraph">Hello, I’m Gioia and I’m a graphic designer. Creativity has always been a part of me, even as a child, when I used to draw my own games. During a difficult time, I stumbled upon Photoshop, and what started as a distraction turned into a true passion. I began learning on my own, creating designs for WordPress and taking on freelance projects. But for years I worked as a Sales Executive, managing designers instead of creating, which left me feeling unfulfilled. Two significant events, one personal and one professional, pushed me to change. I decided to follow my passion for design, investing in myself through intensive courses and obtaining certifications. Since then, everything has changed.</p>
		  <p class="about-paragraph">Since then, my career has taken off: I have worked in international settings, refining my skills and broadening my creative vision. Today, as a freelancer, I collaborate with European startups, offering creative and strategic design solutions to help businesses grow, managing graphic, brand, social, and marketing design projects for companies that aim to make a difference in their industry.</p>
			<p class="about-paragraph">My journey has been challenging, but every obstacle has made me stronger and more aware of my calling. I love what I do, and I’m here to help businesses grow. My goal is to enhance my clients' online presence, help them convey trust, highlight their value proposition, and attract better clients. All of this is achieved by communicating their ideas in a visually appealing and effective way. I firmly believe that graphic design can transform lives and businesses, offering creative and personalised solutions, and I want to use my creativity and skills to make a difference.</p>
			<p class="about-paragraph">Thank you for taking the time to read my story. Together, we can turn your ideas into successful projects.</p>
